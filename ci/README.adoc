== Spring Session for MongoDB CI

Spring Session for MongoDB uses Concourse as it's CI tool of choice. This provides support for:

* Pipelines against the `master` and `2.0.x` branches
* Support for pull requests

=== Creating a pipeline

Using the `fly` command, you can execute a series of commands to create multiple pipelines to manage everything. But
first, some critical credentials are needed.

Create a `credentials.yml` file like this:

[source,yml]
----
github-access-token: <your Personal Access Token from github>
slack: <your slack hook URL>
docker-email: <your docker hub email address>
docker-username: <your docker hub username>
docker-password: <your docker hub password>
artifactory-username: <your artifactory username>
artifactory-password: <your artifactory encoded password>
----

WARNING: Do NOT check this file into source control! If you'll check, `credentials.yml` is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent tihs.

With this in place, run the following `fly` commands to create pipelines:

----
% fly -t spring-team sp -p spring-session-data-mongodb-2.0.x -c ci/pipeline-template.yml -l credentials.yml -v branch=2.0.x
----

With these pipelines in place, you can now activate and expose them:

----
% fly -t spring-team unpause-pipeline -p spring-session-data-mongodb-2.0.x
% fly -t spring-team expose-pipeline -p spring-session-data-mongodb-2.0x
----

=== Making a release

1. Create a new release (on the main branch).
+
----
% ci/create-release.sh <release version> <next snapshot version>
----
+
2. With the release officially tagged, just push it to master.
+
----
% git push
----

The pipeline will pick up the next tag and release it. It will also build a new snapshot and stage it on artifactory.


=== Running CI tasks locally

Since Concourse is built on top of Docker, it's easy to:

* Debug what went wrong on your local machine.
* Test out a a tweak to your `test.sh` script before sending it out.
* Experiment against a new image before submitting your pull request.

All of these use cases are great reasons to essentially run what Concourse does on your local machine.

IMPORTANT: To do this you must have Docker installed on your machine.

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-session-data-mongodb-github openjdk:8-jdk /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-session-data-mongodb-github`.
+
Next, run the `test.sh` script from inside the container:
+
2. `PROFILE=none spring-session-data-mongodb-github/ci/test.sh`

Since the container is binding to your source, you can make edits from your IDE and continue to run build jobs.

If you need to test the `build.sh` script, then do this:

1. `mkdir /tmp/spring-session-data-mongodb-artifactory`
2. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-session-data-mongodb-github --mount type=bind,source="/tmp/spring-session-data-mongodb-artifactory",target=/spring-session-data-mongodb-artifactory openjdk:8-jdk /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-session-data-mongodb-github` and the temporary
artifactory output directory at `spring-session-data-mongodb-artifactory`.
+
Next, run the `build.sh` script from inside the container:
+
3. `spring-session-data-mongodb-github/ci/build.sh`

IMPORTANT: `build.sh` doesn't actually push to Artifactory so don't worry about accidentally deploying anything.
It just deploys to a local folder. That way, the `artifactory-resource` later in the pipeline can pick up these artifacts
and deliver them to artifactory.

NOTE: Docker containers can eat up disk space fast! From time to time, run `docker system prune` to clean out old images.
