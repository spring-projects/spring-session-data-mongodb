IMPORTANT: Spring Session for MongoDB 2.1 runs on Spring Framework 5.1, which has support for *JDK 11*. Spring Session for MongoDB 2.0.x runs on Spring Framework 5.0 and is NOT supported on *JDK 11* despite our pipelines testing against it. The extra
tests are designed to give you a smooth upgrade path. If you are going into production on JDK 11, should need to be using Spring Session for MongoDB 2.1.

IMPORTANT: *JDK 12* is Java's latest version and is unstable. We are testing against it to catch issues early on, but don't support it directly on any version of Spring Session for MongoDB.
