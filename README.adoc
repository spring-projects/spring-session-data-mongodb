IMPORTANT: Spring Session for MongoDB 2.1 runs on Spring Framework 5.1, which has support for *JDK 11*. Spring Session for MongoDB 2.0.x runs on Spring Framework 5.0 and is NOT supported on *JDK 11* despite our pipelines testing against it. The extra
tests are designed to give you a smooth upgrade path. If you are going into production on JDK 11, should need to be using Spring Session for MongoDB 2.1.

IMPORTANT: *JDK 12* is Java's latest version and is unstable. We are testing against it to catch issues early on, but don't support it directly on any version of Spring Session for MongoDB.

== Building Spring Session MongoDB

. Run `mvn clean package`

This will generate the artifact.

You can also import the project into your IDE.

== Releasing Spring Session MongoDB

To do a release (.RELEASE, .RC?, .M?):

. Check in all changes and ensure there are no edited files.
. Bump up the version in `pom.xml` to the desired version and commit the change.
. `git tag <version>` (like v2.0.1.RELEASE)
. Execute a maven deploy.
* For a milestone: `USERNAME=<user> PASSWORD=<encrypted password> mvn -Pdistribute,milestone,docs clean deploy`
* For a release: `USERNAME=<user> PASSWORD=<encrypted password> mvn -Pdistribute,release,docs clean deploy`
* For a release to maven central: `USERNAME=<user> PASSWORD=<nexus password> mvn -Pdistribute,gpg,central clean deploy -s settings.xml` (At SonaType, *close* and *releases*)
. Bump up the version in `pom.xml` again to the next BUILD-SNAPSHOT.
. Commit the change.
. `git push`
. `git push --tags`
. Inspect handiwork at https://repo.spring.io/ or https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories

NOTE: A word about reference documentation. Based upon https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/gradle-build-and-release-faq#user-content-wiki-docs_schema_dist_publication[this], the `distribute` profile contains an artifactory property that is applied to the ZIP file generated by the `docs` profile. A CRON job will scoop up the zipped up docs and unpack them inside the target location.
