[[abstract]]

Spring Session MongoDB provides an API and implementations for managing a user's session information on MongoDB.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

For an introduction to Spring Session as a whole, visit https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/{spring-session-version}/reference/html5/[Spring Session] itself.

== Samples and Guides (Start Here)

If you are looking to get started with Spring Session, the best place to start is our Sample Applications.

=== HttpSession with Mongo

Using Spring Session with `HttpSession` is enabled by adding a Servlet Filter before anything that uses the `HttpSession`.

This section describes how to use Mongo to back `HttpSession` using Java based configuration.

NOTE: The <<samples, HttpSession Mongo Sample>> provides a working sample on how to integrate Spring Session and `HttpSession` using Java configuration.
You can read the basic steps for integration below, but you are encouraged to follow along with the detailed HttpSession Guide when integrating with your own application.

==== Session serialization mechanisms

To be able to persist session objects in MongoDB we need to provide the serialization/deserialization mechanism.

By default, Spring Session MongoDB will use `JdkMongoSessionConverter`.

However, you may switch to `JacksonMongoSessionConverter` by merely adding the following code to your Boot app:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
JacksonMongoSessionConverter mongoSessionConverter() {
    return new JacksonMongoSessionConverter();
}
----

===== JacksonMongoSessionConverter

This mechanism uses Jackson to serialize session objects to/from JSON.

By creating the following bean:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
JacksonMongoSessionConverter mongoSessionConverter() {
    return new JacksonMongoSessionConverter();
}
----

...you are able to switch from the default (JDK-based serialization) to using Jackson.

IMPORTANT: If you are integrating with Spring Security (by storing your sessions in MongoDB), this configuration will
register the proper whitelisted components so Spring Security works properly.

If you would like to provide custom Jackson modules you can do it by explicitly registering modules as shown below:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{code-dir}/src/test/java/org/springframework/session/data/mongo/integration/MongoRepositoryJacksonITest.java[tag=sample]
----

===== JdkMongoSessionConverter

`JdkMongoSessionConverter` uses standard Java serialization to persist session attributes map to MongoDB in a binary form.
However, standard session elements like id, access time, etc are still written as a plain Mongo objects and can be read and queried without additional effort.
`JdkMongoSessionConverter` is used if no explicit `AbstractMongoSessionConverter` Bean has been defined.

There is also a constructor taking `Serializer` and `Deserializer` objects, allowing you to pass custom implementations, which is especially important when you want to use non-default classloader.
