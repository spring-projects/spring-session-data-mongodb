= Contributing to Spring Session MongoDB

Spring Session MongoDB is released under the Apache 2.0 license. If you would like to contribute
something, or simply want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.

== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of conduct].
By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping

None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Data code format conventions. If you use Eclipse you can import formatter settings using the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-data-build/master/etc/ide/eclipse-formatting.xml[Spring Data Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions], if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit message (where XXXX is the issue number).
* By the way, any contributions are likely to be polished. Don't worry! Just use it as a learning experience as you are slowly j√ºrgenized.

== Using GitHub issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage question
please ask on https://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow]. The Spring Session team and the
broader community monitor the https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-session[`spring-session`]
tag.

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much
information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small sample project that
reproduces the problem.
